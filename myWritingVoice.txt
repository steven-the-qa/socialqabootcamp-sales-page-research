Here's my analysis of your writing voice/style:

1. **Direct and Immediate**
- No prefaces or "attention-grabbers" (no "Let's be real," "Look," "Here's the thing")
- Gets straight to the point without setup
- States ideas directly rather than easing into them

2. **Spacing and Structure**
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Liberal use of line breaks to create breathing room
- Uses bullets instead of comma-separated lists
- Breaks up walls of text naturally

3. **Conversational Authenticity**
- Writes like speaking to a friend
- No artificial emphasis or "salesy" language
- Avoids side comments like "Seriously" or "trust me"
- Personal stories are raw and unpolished, not perfectly crafted

4. **Language Choices**
- Uses casual language ("garbage" instead of "poor")
- Comfortable with imperfect phrasing
- No corporate speak or buzzwords
- Contractions and informal language feel natural, not forced

5. **Story Structure**
- Personal anecdotes are straightforward, not dramatically enhanced
- Focuses on the lesson/idea, not the drama of the story
- Maintains flow without artificial transitions
- Uses real examples over hypotheticals

6. **Trust Building**
- Never tries to "sell" - lets ideas speak for themselves
- Admits flaws and past mistakes openly
- Doesn't oversell expertise or success
- Shows rather than tells through examples

7. **Email/Content Style**
- Clean, minimal formatting
- Ideas flow naturally without forced connections
- Uses quotes and examples from real conversations
- Comfortable with imperfect transitions

8. **Key Avoids**
- No artificial urgency
- No "content writer" clich√©s
- No unnecessary emphasis
- No manufactured authority
- No "engagement bait"

The core principle seems to be: trust the strength of the ideas and experiences to engage readers, rather than relying on writing "tricks" or artificial engagement techniques.

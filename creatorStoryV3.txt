I'm the last person you should be asking for QA career advice by any traditional metric.
I barely have 5 years of QA experience. My degree was in Spanish. My first QA job fell into my lap.

But that "fell into my lap" part isn't the whole story.

Back in 2013, I was terrible with people. Two failed relationships, each lasting about 2 months, made me realize I couldn't even hold a basic conversation. Parties felt pointless - I'd spend the whole time overthinking what to say instead of meeting anyone.

I started studying social dynamics just to fix my personal life. I had no idea it would transform my career.

In 2019, I got my first-ever promotion. Not because I was the best cashier, but because my store manager put in a good word when I transferred Walgreens locations. $10/hr became $13.75/hr as a shift lead.

That's when it clicked: being easy to work with and building good relationships was more valuable than just doing the job well.

This mindset helped me jump from retail to tech support at $17/hr. Then to QA at $40k. I got a $5k raise after building a test data tool nobody asked me to build. Then to automation at $70k. Then $80k after a year.

## Why fixing my social life fixed my income

You think you want to land a QA job you love, or make over $100,000 a year. That's why you're reading this, because you know I've done both.
I'll tell you what you actually want in a moment, but first….

Imagine…it's a dewy morning at Trek Bicycle HQ.
I'm walking across the parking lot, reflecting on my 'achievements':
- Escaped customer service in 2020
- Hit $105k salary in under 3 years of QA
- Working on eBike software for a beloved bike company
- Built two test automation solutions
And I was miserable.

Why? Because I'd lost what made my first QA job magical:
- 100% remote work
- Creating automation beyond my job description
- Teaching teammates
- Collaborating on wild side projects

## The 1 thing your career depends on that no QA job can give you

The real problem wasn't just money. It was agency.

I realized I was trapped: Unable to choose my customers, projects, or days off. Dependent on employers. Ceiling on my income.
So I decided to change everything:
    I learned content writing so I wouldn't be another profile in the LinkedIn Ocean.

    Then I dabbled in email marketing so I wouldn't be dependent on any social media platform.

    I learned the basics of sales so I could get paid to learn new skills while helping other QA Engineers upskill for today's job market.

After spending a few months learning from Money Twitter coaches in 2023, I started writing seriously on LinkedIn. The combination of technical skills and social skills made me unstoppable.

This journey led me to achieve incredible things in the first 12 months:
- Landing another job with a 20% higher salary
- Mentoring QA around the world
- Making my first open-source contribution
- Giving my first paid conference talk
- Having coffee chats with CEOs
- Getting featured in Software Testing Weekly (twice)
- Making $1000+ from digital products & services
- and more…
…all from posting content and sending emails.


## The weird reason why learning together helps you teach yourself


I knew nobody was making courses on this, especially not for QA Engineers.

So I reverse-engineered my 5-year career and came up with a system that allows you to download my most valuable skills into your brain in less than 6 months.
Instead of making you teach yourself with video lectures, I made a course where you and I work together to accomplish your learning goals.
I designed a curriculum that doesn't simply train you, but teaches you how to learn.
This is infinitely more valuable because your success in QA — and in life — depends on your ability to learn skills most people are not talking about yet.
It's how you stay ahead of the curve and get first dibs on jobs asking for bleeding-edge skills.
It's how I had 1 year of Playwright experience when most people had 0.


## The accountability advantage most greedy instructors are too 'busy' to offer


But I learned quickest when I had a mentor guiding me or a coach holding me accountable.
I'm going to be both of those for you in this course.
I got sick and tired of seeing courses that were clearly from lazy instructors who'd rather sell than teach.
This course is designed to build your confidence as a QA Engineer, because confident people can learn whatever they want.
You deserve to have that freedom.
I spent 5 years in the trenches writing bad tests, broken test frameworks, sloppy bug reports, boring content, and generally messing up in every area of QA and content-writing, so you can have all the lessons without the scars, and without the stress of learning it all by yourself.

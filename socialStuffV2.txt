You can't get anywhere in QA without other people.

I know what you're thinking: "I just need to get better at automation" or "I just need to learn more tools."

Technical skills alone won't cut it.

I learned this the hard way. Up until I was 20, I was the guy who'd make up any excuse to avoid social events.

Fast forward 10 years, and while I'm no social butterfly, I've figured out enough of this people stuff to make things happen in my career.

## The Secret Nobody Tells You About QA Career Growth

Most people won't tell you this:
- Technical skills alone = Dead end
- Social skills alone = Zero credibility
- Technical + Social skills = Unstoppable

Making friends as an adult isn't "common sense." Especially in tech.

I had to study this stuff on my own because my social skills were garbage. I had terrible role models growing up and ended up with a nice heap of social anxiety.

Turns out it was the best investment I ever made.

## How to Build Real Trust in the QA World

You need three things to build influence:
- Transparency – Show people who you really are
- Proof of Work – Build stuff that proves you know your stuff
- Social Proof – Get people to vouch for you

This course isn't packed with theory.

It's filled with chances for you to get out there and actually do something. With a coach and community backing you up.

You already know the technical stuff. Now it's time to become a "Social QA" – someone who can not only crush the technical side but also inspire others and build a real network.

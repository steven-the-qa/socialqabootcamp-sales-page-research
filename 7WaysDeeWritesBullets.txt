## 7 Ways Dee Writes Bullets

1. Curiosity
Mel martin, Gary halbert...
Find what they're interested in, get inside their world, and tell them something fascinating but incomplete.

- Seventeen lies all intelligent women always tell men!
- When a stock tip is actually considered insider trading

2. Can’t be done
Make a claim or benefit something about your product that is almost unbelievable.

- How to vacuum, dust, and clean your dresser drawer without removing its contents!

3. Proof and Credibility
If you can add something to make it more credible, add it.

- A scientifically proven way (discovered by Isaac Newton) to hit another man with “sledgehammer” like force. (Regardless of your size or speed now).
- The one word Sokrates (perhaps the greatest master of persuasion ever lived) used to “sell” people on his ideas — even though they were dead set against him before!

4. Contrast

- The popular “vegetable” that can make you fat as a whale
- The incredible copywriting secret (used by both PT Barnum and Mother Theresa) that lets you sell to even your coldest, most “sales resistant” prospects.
- A sneaky way to sell more products with a WEAK sales pitch

5. Pain (physical or psychological)

- A secret “bear hug” defence that's so ruthless, there’s a good chance he’ll be pissing blood immediately afterwards.
- What many people do in their wills that could disinherit their children

6. Straight Benefits
Come out with a benefit or claim and state it without any bells and whistles.

- How to get your affiliate web pages featured on CNN, Google, Yahoo, and other high traffic sites 100% free.

7. Tell them what not to do
Inserting specifics like “Four words” make them more powerful.

- The #1 WORST mistake you can make with your wrist when swinging a golf club. (Even if you do everything else “right” your game will fall apart if you make this common mistake nobody talks about.)
- Four words that will destroy your chances sponsoring new reps — even the ones who already want to sign up! ( When I stopped saying these four words — that 99% of network marketers say during calls — my sponsoring rate shot through the roof.)

## Small “how to” guide:

Know your features -> transform features to benefits -> Make benefits more specific, memorable, remarkable.
And it has to convey one of your features. 
That’s it.
